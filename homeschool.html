            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Resonance Roadmap is a 12-year, theme-based homeschool curriculum that follows Josie from toddlerhood
                into young adulthood. Each year is anchored in a core theme such as Sound and Silence, Light and Color,
                Movement and Energy, Time and Change, and Harmony and Pattern. The curriculum is designed to weave academic
                skills, emotional intelligence, life skills, and creative practice into a single coherent path instead of
                separating “school” from real life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than racing through standards, the program returns to a small set of universal ideas at increasing
                levels of depth. Sound, light, motion, story, science, empathy, and contribution show up at every stage
                in age-appropriate ways. The goal is for Josie to graduate not only with academic literacy but with body
                awareness, empathy, self-regulation, practical competence, and a sense of meaning.

                The long-view structure organizes learning into six stages with a yearly theme, guiding question, and 
                integrated focus. This functions as both a planning tool and a narrative for Josie’s growth from ages 1 to 18.

                Year 1, running from December 2025 to December 2026, centers on sound, rhythm, and quiet as primary
                teachers. The goal is to support sensory awareness, secure attachment, emotional language, and pattern
                recognition through everyday experiences with sound and silence.

                    from simple feeling words and calm baskets in early childhood to peer mediation, boundary setting, and

                While the early years are purely enrichment, the curriculum is designed with Pennsylvania homeschool law
                and reporting standards in mind once compulsory attendance begins. The Resonance Roadmap framework maps
                cleanly onto required subject areas, instructional time expectations, portfolio documentation, and annual

            <p>
                Below are examples of structured activities from Year 1 that illustrate how the curriculum blends sensory
                exploration, science, art, empathy, and regulation.
            </p>

            <div class="project-grid">
                <div>
                    <h3>Calm and Quiet Corner</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cozy, predictable space where Josie practices breathing, holding comfort objects, and experiencing
                        short, supported moments of quiet. The Calm Corner is framed as a nurturing choice, not a punishment,
                        and becomes an early form of meditation and self-regulation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Water Xylophone Experiment</h3>
                    <p>
                        A simple science and music activity with jars of water at different levels. Josie taps each jar,
                        listens to the pitch changes, and explores high versus low sounds while watching ripples and colors.
                        It introduces vibration, cause and effect, and pattern through play.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Listening Walk & Sound Map</h3>
                    <p>
                        Short neighborhood or backyard walks framed as “listening like scientists.” Together we notice and
                        name sounds, then record them on a checklist or sound map that shows where each sound came from,
                        what it felt like, and whether it was loud or soft.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Family Drum-Making</h3>
                    <p>
                        A hands-on craft using household containers and simple materials to build drums. We decorate them
                        together, explore soft and loud beats, echo rhythmic patterns, and connect drumming back to the feel
                        of the heartbeat. This builds fine motor skills, rhythm awareness, and a sense of joyful cooperation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sound Map Quiet Sits</h3>
                    <p>
                        Short periods of sitting quietly in one place, drawing or placing symbols on a page to show the
                        direction and type of each sound. Over time, this builds attention, spatial awareness, and embodied
                        mindfulness, while giving us tangible portfolio artifacts.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Calm Corner Rituals</h3>
                    <p>
                        Daily micro-rituals such as a chime to signal “peace time,” three slow breaths, a brief silence, and
                        a soft song. These rituals help normalize quiet as comforting and safe, and they become part of our
                        family’s nervous system language.
