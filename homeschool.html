                This homeschool project is a twelve year curriculum arc that centers emotional intelligence, sound and silence exploration, creative arts, and practical life skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                The work includes a long range roadmap, a detailed first year plan, activity guides, emotional intelligence scaffolding, and practical arts outlines. It is built to feel gentle, rhythmic, and realistic for a real family while still giving a clear sense of direction and developmental flow.

                        <li>Created an emotional intelligence framework that weaves regulation, naming feelings, and healthy boundaries into daily life.</li>
                        <li>Defined life skills and practical arts areas such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, and basic repair tasks.</li>
                        <li>Developed activity guides, checklists, and templates that turn big ideas into simple, doable steps for each day.</li>
