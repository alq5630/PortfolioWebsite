            <p class="page-intro">
                Emery’s Light is a gentle watercolor picture book series created to help young children understand emotions through simple language, warm storytelling, and sensory awareness. 
                In Book One, “What’s That Feeling, Josie?”, a curious toddler begins noticing big feelings rising inside her. Emery appears as a supportive older sister who helps her identify what she feels, breathe through overwhelming moments, and return to connection. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The story blends emotional literacy, sibling bonding, and early self-regulation in a developmentally appropriate way. It uses soft illustrations, grounding language, and a steady rhythm to bring calm to common toddler experiences.

            <p class="page-intro">
                Emery’s Light is designed as a multi book series, each centered on a different emotional experience that toddlers commonly encounter.
            </p>

            <div class="soft-box">
                <p>
                    Future books explore themes such as frustration, boundaries, separation anxiety, sibling connection, and sensory overwhelm. 
                    Each installment follows the same heart centered structure: Emery models emotional awareness, gentle language, and grounded support that children can easily imitate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Book One serves as the primary example for this portfolio, showcasing your approach to early emotional education through storytelling and illustration.
