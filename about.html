            <p class="page-intro">
                I am an educational content designer with a background that blends curriculum design, emotional development science, body based learning, and creative storytelling. My work sits at the intersection of teaching, psychology, and technology. I create experiences that help learners understand themselves, engage deeply with new concepts, and feel supported throughout the process.

            <h2 class="section-title">My Path</h2>
            <p>
                I began my career in massage therapy and bodywork education. I taught in a collegiate massage therapy program where I designed full courses, wrote curriculum, built quizzes and videos, and created a teaching style that centered emotional presence, anatomy through imagery, and practical application. I learned how to break complex ideas into clear, structured lessons, and how to support students who learn in very different ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time I became deeply interested in empathy, emotional intelligence, and the different ways people process the world. I completed a self designed master's degree focused on empathy science, successful psychopathy, and trauma informed learning. Since then, I have developed the Empathy Spectrum Disorder framework, a full assessment toolkit, and multiple educational resources for clinicians, parents, and students.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also an author and creative storyteller. I write emotional development books for children, including my watercolor series called Emery's Light in honor of my angel baby who I lost to a full-term stillbirth in 2023. I create guided workbooks for parents and educators. I write research based manuscripts on compassion and emotional clarity. My creative work is always rooted in real developmental psychology and grounded emotional understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside this work, I am earning a software engineering certificate. I study Java, C++, and Web Development. I enjoy bringing structure, logic, and modern tools into my educational projects. My goal is to build learning experiences that pair human warmth with clean, accessible, well organized interfaces.

            <h2 class="section-title">My Values</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that learning should feel safe, structured, and intuitive. I design with the whole person in mind. I want learners to feel calm and curious rather than overwhelmed. I value clarity, warmth, and a grounded approach that respects the emotional and cognitive realities of the people who will use the materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work is guided by a simple philosophy. Learning works best when the materials feel like they were built for a real person, not for a generic ideal. When content is thoughtful and emotionally aware, people engage more openly, understand more deeply, and feel supported as they grow.
