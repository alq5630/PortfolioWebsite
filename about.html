                <h1 class="page-title">About me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am an educator, curriculum designer, and emerging software engineer with a background in
                    health sciences, psychology, and empathy research. I have taught and supported students in
                    community college massage therapy programs, designed continuing education style trainings
                    for practitioners, and built home learning frameworks for early childhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work often sits where disciplines meet. I like to translate complex concepts in neuroscience,
                    trauma, and emotional development into language and structures that real people can use. I care
                    deeply about how learning feels in the body and how it changes the way people move through their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently expanding my technical skills through formal software engineering study. This lets me
                    think about learning experiences not only from the perspective of curriculum and facilitation, but
                    also in terms of systems, interfaces, and data.

                <h2 class="subheading">Current interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Right now I am especially interested in how empathy, regulation, and cognition interact during
                    learning, and how we can design educational materials that support both understanding and nervous
                    system resilience. I am also exploring how code and automation can free up educators to spend more
                    time in genuine human connection.
