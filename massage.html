                Format: Multi modal curriculum • Role: Instructor, curriculum designer, media creator<br>
                Audience: Community college massage therapy students (first year through pre licensing)
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This curriculum was created for community college massage therapy students who need to build a solid
                foundation in anatomy, physiology, clinical reasoning, and professional touch. Many students enter the
                program with uneven science backgrounds, strong hands on instincts, and significant test anxiety. I
                wanted to create a learning environment that felt structured, clear, accessible, and deeply embodied.
            </p>
            <p>
                The full curriculum integrates a complete course website, PowerPoint lecture decks, quizzes and
                assessments, printable worksheets, clinical flow checklists, guided muscle meditations, demonstration
                videos, and chapter aligned study resources. Each piece is designed to reduce overwhelm, support
                different learning styles, and help students connect textbook content to the lived experience of their
                bodies and the bodies they work with.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Goals of the curriculum</h2>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Make anatomy and physiology feel approachable and pattern based, not like memorizing random lists</li>
                <li>Support students with test anxiety through scaffolding, predictable structure, and repetition</li>
                <li>Encourage hands on exploration as they learn origins, insertions, and actions</li>
                <li>Build clinical reasoning, not just memorization</li>
                <li>Increase confidence for both classroom exams and licensing preparation</li>
                <li>Make each lesson feel organized, grounded, and applicable to real massage practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Components I created</h2>

            <div class="project-grid">
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Full course website</h3>
                    <p>
                        I built a central course website that serves as the home base for students. It houses weekly
                        modules, chapter resources, lecture notes, study guides, and lab preparation. Content is
                        organized in a predictable way so that overwhelmed or neurodivergent learners can quickly see
                        what is due, what to review, and how pieces connect. The site is mobile friendly so students can
                        review materials on the go between work, family responsibilities, and class.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. PowerPoint lecture decks</h3>
                    <p>
                        For key chapters, I designed visual, digestible slide decks that walk students from concept to
                        example to clinical application. Slides use simplified diagrams, clear labeling, and consistent
                        visual language to reduce cognitive load. Each deck is structured to support notetaking and
                        later review rather than overwhelming students with text.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Quizzes and assessments</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created low stakes chapter quizzes, origin insertion action recall drills, applied scenario
                        questions, and short answer reflections. These assessments are aligned with course outcomes and
                        licensing expectations, and they give both students and instructors real information about what
                        is landing and what needs more support.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>4. Muscle meditations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muscle meditations are a unique tool I developed to help students learn anatomy through guided
                        breath, body awareness, and movement cues. Instead of memorizing a list of facts, students are
                        invited to feel specific muscles, notice how they move, and connect that experience to origin,
                        insertion, and action. These scripts also help anxious learners ground themselves before exams
                        or hands on sessions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Printable workbook pages</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed chapter aligned worksheets, origin insertion action practice sheets, review pages,
                        and weekly progress trackers that students can use in lab, clinic, or self study. The pages are
                        simple, repeatable, and focused on helping students see patterns across content rather than
                        cramming the night before an exam.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. Clinical flow checklists and videos</h3>
                    <p>
                        To support integration, I created clinical flow checklists that guide students through intake,
                        assessment, planning, technique, and closing. I also planned and began producing short
                        demonstration videos on palpation landmarks, body mechanics, and stroke sequences to reinforce
                        what we cover in person.

            <h2 class="section-title">Future development</h2>
            <p>
                Next steps for this curriculum include expanding the workbook into a fully illustrated student manual,
                filming the complete demonstration video library, converting the muscle meditations into an audio
                playlist, and exploring digital flashcard and app based versions of the study tools. The existing suite
                already functions well in a community college setting and can be scaled into continuing education
                courses for new massage therapists and instructors.
