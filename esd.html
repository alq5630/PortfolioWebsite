                Format: Theoretical framework, assessment toolkit, and educational website (in progress)<br>

            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Empathy Spectrum Disorder (ESD) framework grew out of my graduate research on empathy, successful
                psychopathy, trauma, and emotional regulation. It is an attempt to describe the different ways empathy
                can become dysregulated across a spectrum rather than as a simple lack or excess of empathy. The model
                considers affective empathy, cognitive empathy, nervous system regulation, and behavior together.
            </p>
            <p>
                ESD is designed as a conceptual and educational tool rather than a formal diagnosis at this stage. The
                framework currently includes a white paper under journal review, a multi part assessment toolkit, a
                clinician facing training curriculum, and an in progress public facing website that translates the
                ideas into language that practitioners, parents, and learners can actually use.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Core questions this framework addresses</h2>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Why do some people feel overwhelmed by others while others feel almost nothing at all</li>
                <li>How do hyperempathy and hypoempathy show up differently in thought, body, and behavior</li>
                <li>What patterns of nervous system regulation sit underneath common empathy problems</li>
                <li>How can we talk about psychopathy and narcissism without collapsing all low empathy into one box</li>
                <li>What tools can help clinicians and educators map empathy patterns without pathologizing everything</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Subtype model</h2>
            <p>
                The framework organizes empathy dysregulation into a small set of subtypes that describe how affective,
                cognitive, and regulatory patterns combine. These are not labels for people as much as maps of
                recurring patterns that show up in real lives and relationships.

                    <ul class="checklist">
                        <li><strong>Type A: Emotional Hypo Empathy</strong> – muted emotional resonance, often paired with intact or strong cognitive empathy</li>
                        <li><strong>Type B: Emotional Hyper Empathy</strong> – intense emotional resonance, somatic flooding, difficulty separating self from others</li>
                        <li><strong>Type C: Cognitive Dominant Empathy</strong> – strong perspective taking with limited emotional resonance, highly rational style</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul class="checklist">
                        <li><strong>Type D: Empathic Dysregulation</strong> – oscillation between over engagement and shutdown, often linked to fawn and freeze patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Type E: Empathic Shutdown</strong> – protective blunting of empathy in response to trauma or chronic overwhelm</li>
                        <li><strong>Type F: Dark Empathy</strong> – strategic use of cognitive empathy in ways that can be manipulative or harmful</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="note">
                The subtype model is used as a teaching and reflection tool with clinicians, students, and parents. It
                is designed to deepen nuance rather than create new boxes to keep people in.

            <p>
                Alongside the conceptual framework, I am building a multi part toolkit for clinicians and educators.
                Each tool focuses on a different layer of empathy, regulation, and behavior. Together, they form a
                structured way to explore how empathy works in a person’s life.

                    The ESD framework is also becoming a public facing website that will eventually include guided

                    being built from scratch with attention to accessibility, clear navigation, and trauma aware tone.

            <p>
                Next steps for the ESD framework include formal validation studies for the assessment tools, expansion
                of the clinician training curriculum, and the development of parent and educator tracks. I am also
                interested in collaborating with researchers and practitioners who want to explore applications of the
                model in clinical, educational, and community settings.
