            <h1 class="page-title">How I design learning experiences</h1>
            <p class="page-intro">
                My background in health sciences, empathy research, and teaching informs how I structure content.
                I design with the body, the nervous system, and the emotional life of the learner in mind.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Clarify the purpose and learners</h2>
            <p>
                I begin by asking who this content is for, what they are carrying in with them, and what needs
                to feel different by the end. I like to frame this as a combination of knowledge, skill, and
                nervous system outcomes. It is not just what they can recall, but what feels more possible or
                less overwhelming after they complete the learning experience.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Define clear and honest learning objectives</h2>
            <p>
                I write learning objectives that are specific, realistic, and transparent. Learners deserve to know
                what we are actually trying to do together. I use verbs that map to different cognitive levels
                and make sure the assessments line up with these targets.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Chunk content into digestible arcs</h2>
            <p>
                I organize material into arcs rather than isolated units. Each chunk of content includes a small
                amount of teaching, an example or story, a chance to practice or reflect, and a moment to pause.
                This helps learners stay engaged without flooding them with information.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Build assessments that feel meaningful</h2>
            <p>
                I design quizzes, self inventories, and applied tasks that give both the learner and the instructor
                useful information. I like to combine traditional question types with reflection prompts and
                scenario based items. Where possible, I include low stakes check ins that normalize mistakes.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Weave in accessibility and emotional safety</h2>
            <p>
                My work is grounded in trauma aware practice and empathy science. I pay attention to language,
                pacing, and examples so that learners from different backgrounds can see themselves in the material
                without feeling pathologized. I aim for clarity without condescension and seriousness without heaviness.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Integrate technology in service of clarity</h2>
            <p>
                I use tools like learning management systems, slides, interactive documents, and in some cases code
                examples, but only when they genuinely support the learning goal. My software engineering training
                allows me to collaborate with developers and think about how content will live inside actual systems.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Iterate with feedback and lived use</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite insights come from watching real people use the materials. Student comments, questions,
                and emotional reactions all inform the next revision cycle. I treat every course or resource as a living
                project that can keep improving over time.
